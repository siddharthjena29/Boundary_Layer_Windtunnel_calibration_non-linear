Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Calibration
This repository contains code and data for calibrating a boundary layer wind tunnel with a 5m x 5m test cross-section. The calibration process involves:

Data Collection: Gather data on wind tunnel settings, temperature, pressure, and velocity.
Data Preparation: Prepare the dataset, including handling missing values and outliers.
Calibration: Apply machine learning techniques to calibrate the wind tunnel.
Validation: Validate the calibration using a separate dataset.
Analysis: Analyze the calibrated results and assess accuracy.
Visualization: Visualize the calibration and validation results.
Conclusion: Summarize the findings and calibration's success.
Getting Started
